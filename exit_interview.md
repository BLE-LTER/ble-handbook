# Exit Interview Questions

When a student, PI, or other researcher leaves BLE, the information manager must conduct an exit interview with that person to make sure their BLE data get archived.

## The Questions

What are the data products you have created or are in charge of?

Are there plans to publish or archive these data products and if so, where and when?

What would a person taking over these data products need to know?

How can we (BLE IM) help? E.g., we can help document metadata now for posterity.
