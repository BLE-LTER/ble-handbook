new DOI. If you visit an old link, the EDI data portal will alert you to the newest revision.

**Use**

All BLE LTER data packages can be found in the data catalog on our website:
https://ble.lter.edu/catalog. There is also a guide on our data catalog page describing how to
access metadata for BLE data packages ([linked here](https://utexas.box.com/v/ble-access-metadata)). The guide gives an overview to the EDI
portal, which digests metadata we provide to generate a user-friendly display of important
information such as variable units and code-definitions. Please follow as you explore BLE data.

Regards,
