## to send to first-time data submitters, once we have a staging

Hi all,

I have worked through your materials and created a mock-up of the data + metadata on EDI's staging site here: 
https://portal-s.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-ble&identifier=25.

Next step: Danny and Susan, please review the data and metadata as presented in the mockup above and get back to me with any inaccuracies you spot or any edits you wish me to make. 
- If you don't have edits, I will publish this to EDI's production server. This dataset will then be live, archived and published to the public. We pat ourselves on the back for a job well done. 
- If you have edits, I will make them, send you another mockup, and we repeat this process. 
Please try and let me know either way soon, preferably this week or early next week, so that we have time before the proposal deadline in case there are edits to be made.
Some changes you may notice I've made to your provided data and metadata:
- Minor edits to abstract and methods texts for clarity
- I added standard Core Program columns and re-formatted certain columns to follow BLE practices

How to conduct your review: 
- First, review the information on the landing page after clicking on the above URL.
- Then, click on the "View Full Metadata" button next to the big "Data Package Summary" title near the top of the page. 
- Review the information under "General Information".
- Then, click on the "Show Details" toggle button. This will expand all the sections. 
- Review the information under "Detailed Metadata". 
- Feel free to skim through the 133 taxonomic trees. I have expanded each unique taxonomic name in the dataset into its full taxonomic tree, so this section is huge. This is done so that our dataset is more discover-able to potential data users, for example, someone searching for a higher rank, like the family Naididae  will still be able to find our entry Embolocephalus nikolskyi.
- Here's an infographic that shows you where the buttons are on the EDI portal: https://utexas.app.box.com/v/ble-access-metadata 

Let me know if you have any more questions! Hope to hear from you soon, and thank you for your work.
