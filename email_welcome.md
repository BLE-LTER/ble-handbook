## The Email - adjust for student, post-doc, and so on

Dear Person,

Welcome to the team! My name is An and along with Tim Whiteaker whom you'll meet later for sure, we are the data/information managers for the BLE LTER. Ask us anything about existing/upcoming BLE or LTER data, our website, mailing lists, data analysis, data munging, etc.

I have added you to our relevant mailing lists. [ble-lter-all@utlists.utexas.edu](mailto:ble-lter-all@utlists.utexas.edu) is for general announcements to the entire group, and [ble-lter-student@utlists.utexas.edu](mailto:ble-lter-student@utlists.utexas.edu) is for students. You should start receiving messages from them soon, and remember that you can send your own messages (maybe an introduction?) to these groups as well.

On [our website](https://ble.lternet.edu/) you can read more about the project and team. Of particular interest may be:

* [About BLE](https://ble.lternet.edu/about), with links to our various policies.
* [Data Links](https://ble.lternet.edu/finddata), to see what we've already published.

I will work on adding you to [our website](https://ble.lternet.edu/) soon. One other thing is I'll need a picture of you and a brief bio, for our student research webpage. You can read [bios from all our current graduate students](https://ble.lternet.edu/student) for inspiration.

If and when you're ready to publish data (NSF rule is: within two years of data collection), it's critical that you work with us.  You can [find our guidelines here](https://ble.lternet.edu/submitdata). We make sure datasets get published so that they properly show up in [our data catalog](https://ble.lternet.edu/catalog), and we also aim for top notch metadata and interoperability in support of [FAIR data practices](https://data.org/resources/the-fair-data-principles/).

We'd also like to be involved as you publish journal articles or other works with BLE. We can help you cite BLE data effectively, acknowledge BLE support, and we may also be able to help with figures and maps.  Once published, we'll make sure the work appears in [BLE's bibliography](https://ble.lternet.edu/bibliography).

We look forward to getting to know you. BLE truly is a wonderful group of people to work and play with, so let's go do some science together!

With warm regards from your IM team,
An Nguyen and Tim Whiteaker
